# PrototypeSouls

**Prototype Souls** is meant to be my way of improving my skills using Gameplay Ability System and Multiplayer with Unreal Engine (5.3). I have been kind of obsessed with Brandon Sanderson's books lately and, while reading, I thought: "Bloody hell, wouldn't it be amazing if some of the magic systems of this book were implemented into a game?" So, that's me trying to do this.

# 1. Gameplay Ability System (GAS)

The official Unreal Engine's GAS documentations reads as follow: "The Gameplay Ability System is a framework for building attributes, abilities, and interactions that an Actor can own and trigger. The system is designed to be adapted to a wide variety of Gameplay-Driven projects such as Role-Playing Games(RPGs), Action-Adventure games, and Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas games(MOBA)."
Here you can find some useful sites with GAS examples:

# 2. Gameplay Mechanics

Before starting with the Cosmere's gameplay mechanics we need to have a strong base that, by itself, it's funny and robust. For this, I'll try to make something similar to God of War (2018).
