# PrototypeSouls

**Prototype Souls** is meant to be my way of improving my skills using Gameplay Ability System and Multiplayer with Unreal Engine (5.3). I have been kind of obsessed with Brandon Sanderson's books lately and, while reading, I thought: "Bloody hell, wouldn't it be amazing if some of the magic systems of this book were implemented into a game?" So, that's me trying to do this.
